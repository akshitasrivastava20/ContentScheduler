# Content Scheduler - System Testing Guide

## üéØ Complete System Status

Your LinkedIn Content Scheduler is now fully deployed with all components working. Here's how to test and verify everything is functioning properly:

## üîß Testing Endpoints

### 1. Main Application (Vercel)
- **URL**: https://scheduler.akshita.xyz
- **Schedule Page**: https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/schedule
- **LinkedIn Auth**: https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/api/linkedin/auth

### 2. API Endpoints
- **LinkedIn Status**: `GET https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/api/linkedin/status`
- **Manual Publish**: `POST https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/api/trigger-publish`
- **Schedule Post**: `POST https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/api/schedule`
- **Auto Publish**: `POST https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/api/publish`

### 3. Cloudflare Worker
- **Direct URL**: https://content-scheduler-worker.akshita-srivastava-1505.workers.dev
- **Custom Domain**: https://worker.akshita.xyz (with your DNS record)
- **Status Check**: https://worker.akshita.xyz/status
- **Manual Trigger**: `POST https://worker.akshita.xyz/trigger`

## üöÄ System Flow Test

### Step 1: Connect LinkedIn Account
1. Visit https://scheduler.akshita.xyz/schedule
2. Click "Connect your LinkedIn account"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Verify green "LinkedIn Connected" status

### Step 2: Schedule a Post
1. Write your post content
2. Select future date/time (at least 5+ minutes from now)
3. Click "Schedule Post"
4. Confirm success message

### Step 3: Verify Automation
The Cloudflare Worker automatically runs every 5 minutes and will:
- Check for posts scheduled for the current time
- Publish them to LinkedIn using your stored token
- Log the results

### Step 4: Manual Testing
Use the "‚ö° Check & Post Pending Posts Now" button to manually trigger publishing without waiting for the cron job.

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Worker Logs
```bash
npx wrangler tail --format pretty
```

### Monitor Database
Your MongoDB Atlas database stores:
- LinkedinToken collection: OAuth tokens and user profiles
- Post collection: Scheduled posts with status

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If LinkedIn Auth Fails:
- Check environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify LinkedIn app redirect URI matches exactly
- Check MongoDB connection

### If Posts Don't Publish:
- Verify LinkedIn token hasn't expired
- Check worker logs for errors
- Test manual trigger endpoint

### If Worker Doesn't Run:
- Verify cron trigger is enabled in Cloudflare
- Check worker environment variables
- Test worker endpoints directly

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your system is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ LinkedIn authentication completes successfully
2. ‚úÖ Posts can be scheduled via the form
3. ‚úÖ Manual trigger publishes pending posts
4. ‚úÖ Worker logs show automatic execution every 5 minutes
5. ‚úÖ Posts appear on your LinkedIn profile at scheduled times

## üéâ Your System is Complete!

The LinkedIn Content Scheduler is now fully operational with:
- **Automated Publishing**: Every 5 minutes via Cloudflare Worker
- **Manual Control**: Instant publishing via frontend button
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with LinkedIn
- **Reliable Storage**: MongoDB Atlas for posts and tokens
- **Custom Domains**: Clean URLs for both app and worker

Your content will now be automatically published to LinkedIn at the scheduled times!
